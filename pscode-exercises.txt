// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(If the number is divisible by 2 then even
else odd)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(a-Ask for 5 numbers (1,2,3,4,5)
b-Add those 5 numbers together
-Divide total of numbers just added by 5
-The total will be the average )
c-The smallest (minimum) will be the number closest to zero in value
-The largest (maximum) will be the number furthest to zero in value
d-1+2+3+4+5=15 15/5=3  The average of the five numbers is 3.
-The minimum is 1 and the maximum is 5.)
